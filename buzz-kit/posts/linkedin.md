I just released it-seems-fine-linter, a CLI that scans code for vibes-based engineering phrases and scores risk. It supports custom phrase packs and strict mode for CI gating.

Quickstart:
```bash
npx it-seems-fine-linter --paths src
```

If your team has specific phrases to catch, I would love feedback.
