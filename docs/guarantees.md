# Guarantees & Non-Goals

**Guarantees**
- Deterministic scoring for the same files and phrase config.
- Scans only comments and PR metadata (no runtime execution).
- No network calls; runs fully offline.

**Non-Goals**
- Not a security scanner or static analyzer.
- Does not interpret runtime behavior or test coverage.
- Does not lint general style or formatting.
